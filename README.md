# Kernel-Death-example-with-ngspice

In this example the same test circuit is being run for 100 simulations. The kernel death issue occurs at random simulation number. The table below shows some results.

| Test Run  | Kernel Death on Simulation Number |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | 24  |
| 2  | no death  |
